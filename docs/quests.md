# Quests

## Jeepers Creepers (Aston, Kelly)

Targeted at level 15, but you might get it as early as lvl 12-13. Seems too hard at first. Rushing and war-crying kills you quickly. Sneaking and taking them one-by-one works fine. Stealth really shines here, even if unraised.

**1850 EXP, 12% of level 15.**

_Add hint about stealth to mission briefing?_

## Underground Park Shrines (Aston, Kelly)

Feels easier then Creepers at first. Larger groups with evasive mages can be challenging, though. Three shrines to find. That's one big park...

**4500 EXP, 25% of level 16.**

## Astronomer's Notes (Aston, Gerassimo)


**5000 EXP, 27% of level 16.**

## Smuggler Book (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

Went right past the book and cleared the section. Found the book on the way back.

** 1000 EXP, 6.7% of level 15.**

## Contraband (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

_Quest items as random drops. Not sure if this is a good idea. I got all but one twice on a single run, so it might be fine._

**4x1000 EXP, 27% of level 15.**

## Smuggler Leader (Below Aston 2, Imp. Leader)

Guild leader was a wimp, continuing the tradition.

_The kill does not count unless you received the quest already. Considering that many players will just clear the area right away this might need fixing._

**2000 EXP, 13% of level 15.**

## Lab 1 (level 10) (Labyrinth, Observer)

Did it too late, made it very easy. The hidden key is a nice touch. You either see it... or you don't.

_Seems way too hard at level 10. Move to 15?_

**928 EXP, 7% of level 14.**

## Lab 2 (level 15) (Labyrinth, Laros)

Demon summoning rituals and no regeneration, but lots of potions to be found.

_Once again way too hard at its level. Maybe at 20?_

**2982 EXP, 9% of level 20.**

## Lab 3 (level 20) (Labyrinth, no quest giver)

This was... tedious. The idea is neat, it looks compact, but it's a lot of doors and rooms to carry that darned thing through.

_Once again way too hard at its level. Maybe at 25?_

**6896 EXP, 10% of level 25.**

## Earth Underground

A whole area, not just a quest. Beginnings seem easy for the advertised level 20, later stages require up to a level 30 or better. Teamwork could do wonders here.

**54000 EXP, 47% of level 30, in 30 steps.**

## Fire Underground

Platoon commander, with a bunch of... less than smart followers, activating defenses and collecting... something.

_A lot of potential, but barely functional. Demons run back and forth instead of attacking, our soldiers cannot escape and die instead of fighting back. Needs another pass, improving demon and soldier AI._

** 3 * 1000 + 2000 + 3000 + 3 * 4000 + ~30 * 2000 = 80,000 EXP, 30% of level 40.**
